# Simultaneous Equasions

We were doing systems of equasions in math, so I was wondering how the calculator calculates them. I was looking through some methods and found one called "Cramer's Rule" (I'm pretty sure calculators use other methods such as Gaussian Elimination). So I thought I'd try implementing it in python. So this is just a small lil' script that calculates simultaneous equasions for me. I think it works properly (or at least for the inputs I tested).
